- ‚úÖ **Unauthorized Handling** - Proper redirection for insufficient permissions
- ‚úÖ **Loading States** - User-friendly loading indicators during auth checks

### **Updated Routing (`src/App.tsx`)**
- ‚úÖ **Wrapped with AuthProvider** - All routes protected with authentication context
- ‚úÖ **Role-Specific Routes** - Examples of how to implement role-based routing
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Routing Structure** - Resolved nested Routes issues for better navigation
- ‚úÖ **Demo Route Added** - `/matching-demo` route to showcase the matching engine

## üß† **Smart Candidate Matching Engine**

### **Updated Data Models (`src/types/data.ts`)**
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Job Interface** - Added matching fields:
  - `requiredSkills[]`
  - `requiredCertifications[]`
  - `educationLevelRequired`
  - `yearsOfExperienceRequired`
  - `desiredJobType`
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Experience Interface** - Added `skills[]` array for detailed experience tracking
- ‚úÖ **UserProfile Extensions** - Complete matching criteria support

### **Candidate Matching Engine (`src/services/api/candidateMatchingEngine.ts`)**
- ‚úÖ **calculateMatchScore()** - Returns 0-100 score with weighted criteria:
  - **Skills**: 25% - Keyword matching with bonus for extra skills
  - **Experience Keywords**: 25% - Job title and description analysis
  - **Years of Experience**: 20% - Requirements vs actual with bonus system
  - **Education**: 15% - Level matching with field relevance
  - **Certifications**: 10% - Required vs possessed certifications
  - **Job Type**: 5% - Preference alignment
- ‚úÖ **findBestJobMatches()** - Sorts and returns top job matches for candidates
- ‚úÖ **Detailed Match Analytics** - Comprehensive breakdown with matched/missing elements
- ‚úÖ **Helper Functions** - Keyword extraction, education level scoring, field relevance

### **Integration Services**
- ‚úÖ **Recommendation Service** - Compatible with existing codebase
- ‚úÖ **Mock Data** - Rich test data for 4 job seekers and 7 job postings
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces

## üé™ **Interactive Demo Component**

### **Matching Demo (`src/components/matching/MatchingDemo.tsx`)**
- ‚úÖ **Live Candidate-Job Matching** - Interactive dropdowns to test any combination
- ‚úÖ **Visual Score Breakdown** - Color-coded scoring with detailed analytics
- ‚úÖ **Skills Analysis** - Shows matched vs missing skills with visual indicators
- ‚úÖ **Best Jobs for Candidate** - Ranked list of job matches for selected candidate

## üöÄ **Usage Instructions**

### **Test the Authentication:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Click any "Use Demo" button to auto-fill credentials
3. Login successfully and navigate to different routes
4. Test role-based access (currently all routes allow all roles)

### **Test the Matching Engine:**
1. After login, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/matching-demo`
2. Use the dropdowns to select different candidate/job combinations
3. View detailed scoring breakdowns and match analytics
4. See ranked job recommendations for each candidate

### **Key Features to Test:**
- **Skills Matching** - Notice how Sarah Johnson (Lead Teacher) scores 91% for Lead Preschool Teacher position
- **Experience Weighting** - See how Michael Chen's special education background affects different job scores
- **Education Levels** - Compare Amanda Taylor's MBA advantage for director positions
- **Missing Skills** - View what skills candidates need to improve their matches
