# Daycare Staffing & Recommendation Engine

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a **Daycare Staffing & Recommendation Platform** that intelligently matches Job Seekers with open positions at Daycare Organizations. The system features a sophisticated recommendation engine that analyzes candidate profiles against job requirements to provide detailed match scores and actionable insights.

## 👥 Core User Roles

1. **Job Seeker**: Candidates with detailed profiles including skills, experience, and education
2. **Daycare Organization**: Employers who post jobs and review candidate recommendations  
3. **Recruiter**: Third-party users who receive curated reports of top candidates for specific jobs

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Data Models (`src/types/data.ts`)
- **Strongly-typed TypeScript interfaces** and enums for the entire application
- Core interfaces: `UserProfile`, `Job`, `Experience`, `Education`, `Application`, `Organization`
- Enums: `JobType`, `JobStatus`, `ApplicationStatus`, `UserRole`

### ✅ 2. Mock Data
- **Comprehensive mock data** for realistic development and testing:
  - `src/data/mockJobSeekers.ts` - 8 detailed candidate profiles
  - `src/data/mockJobs.ts` - 7 diverse job postings with detailed requirements
  - `src/data/mockRecruiters.ts` - Recruiter profiles and partnerships
  - `src/data/mockAtsData.ts` - Application tracking data

### ✅ 3. Candidate Matching Engine (`src/services/candidateMatchingEngine.ts`)
- **Main function**: `calculateMatchScore(job, candidate)` returns 0-100 score
- **Scoring criteria** with proper weights:
  - Skills: 25%
  - Experience Title Match: 25% 
  - Years of Experience: 20%
  - Education: 15%
  - Certifications: 10%
  - Job Type Preference: 5%
- **Individual scoring functions** for each criterion
- **Smart matching algorithms** with bonuses and penalties

### ✅ 4. Recommendation Service (`src/services/recommendationService.ts`)
- **`getRecommendationsForJob()`** - Returns top candidates sorted by match score
- **`generateStrengthsAndGaps()`** - Analyzes candidate vs job fit with detailed insights
- **`generateRecommendationSummary()`** - Creates human-readable reports for recruiters

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Jest Tests
- **`candidateMatchingEngine.test.ts`** - 13 test cases covering all scoring scenarios
- **`recommendationService.test.ts`** - 11 test cases for recommendation logic
- **All tests passing** ✅ with 100% coverage of core functionality

### Test Coverage Includes:
- Score boundaries (0-100 range validation)
- Perfect match vs poor match scenarios
- Missing data handling
- Weight distribution verification
- Edge cases and error handling

## 📊 Demo & Performance

### Recommendation Engine Demo (`src/demo/recommendationEngineDemo.ts`)
Demonstrates the engine with real scenarios:
- Lead Preschool Teacher position matching
- Special Education Teacher matching  
- Cross-job analysis for candidates
- Recruiter performance metrics

### Sample Results:
```
🏆 Top 3 Recommendations for Lead Preschool Teacher:
1. Sarah Johnson - 91% match
   Experience: 5 years
   Current Role: Lead Preschool Teacher
   Location: San Francisco, CA

2. Jessica Williams - 84% match  
   Experience: 2 years
   Current Role: Early Childhood Educator
   Location: San Francisco, CA

3. Amanda Taylor - 78% match
   Experience: 8 years
   Current Role: Childcare Center Director
   Location: Berkeley, CA
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Built With:
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed language for reliability
- **React** - Modern UI framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Jest** - Testing framework
- **Existing foundation** - Enhanced and built around pre-existing codebase

## 📈 Matching Algorithm Details

### Skills Matching (25% weight)
- Compares candidate skills against job description and requirements
- Provides bonus for candidates with many relevant skills
- Case-insensitive keyword matching

### Experience Matching (25% weight)  
- Analyzes job title similarity using keyword matching
- Rewards exact title matches
- Considers related experience in childcare/education

### Years of Experience (20% weight)
- Extracts required years from job requirements using regex
- Full score for meeting requirements + bonus for extra experience
- Proportional scoring for candidates below requirements

### Education Matching (15% weight)
- Matches degree levels (Bachelor's, Master's, Associate's)
- Field-specific matching (Early Childhood Education)
- Partial credit for having any degree vs specific requirements

### Certifications (10% weight)
- Identifies required certifications (CPR, First Aid, licenses)
- Binary matching with proportional scoring
- High score if no certifications required

### Job Type Preference (5% weight)
- Matches candidate preferences with job type
- Supports multiple preferred job types
- Neutral score if preferences not specified
